# ChatGPT Conversation Copier

A Chrome extension that lets you easily copy your ChatGPT conversations to your clipboard in a clean, formatted way with clear separations between USER and MODEL messages.

**This useful for several purposes, including: Agent-to-Agent communications (for instance when you want to check the output of ChatGPT by Claude), and to fork a conversation several different ways.**

The output of the extension is formatted as follows:

```
================================
USER:
Could you teach me a word only you know, that I don't know?
================================
MODEL:
I love this request. Alright—here's a word I coined just for you:


**_nexalgia_** _(noun)_

**/nekˈsal.dʒə/**


**Definition:**

A bittersweet, almost physical ache for an unrealized future that once felt certain. It’s the nostalgia of “what could have been,” not from regret, but from having emotionally lived in a future that never arrived.


**Example:**


> “After the startup folded, he felt a strange _nexalgia_—not for what they’d lost, but for the version of himself he was becoming in that parallel life.”


Let me know if you want a verb form or adjective too. We can flesh out its etymology and variants like it's going in the OED.

## For Software Engineering Students

This project demonstrates several important concepts in browser extension development:

- **Manifest V3**: The latest Chrome extension architecture
- **Content Scripts**: How to interact with web page content
- **DOM Manipulation**: Extracting and processing page elements
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions
- **Chrome APIs**: Using browser functionality like clipboard access

The code is structured into three main components:
- `manifest.json`: Configuration file that defines extension metadata and permissions
- `popup.html/popup.js`: User interface for the extension
- `content.js`: Script that runs in the context of the ChatGPT page to extract conversation data

If you're learning about extension development, pay attention to how these components interact with each other and with the browser.

## Development Notes

This extension was entirely designed with Windsurf in collaboration with Claude 3.7 with extended thinking. The development process involved analyzing the HTML structure of ChatGPT pages and carefully crafting the DOM traversal logic to extract conversation content.

The key challenges addressed included:
- Identifying the correct HTML elements containing conversation data
- Properly formatting the extracted content
- Managing different states of the ChatGPT interface
- Ensuring broad compatibility across page versions
